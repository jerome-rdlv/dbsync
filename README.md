# dbsync

A database synchronization command line tool with support for replacements and SSH tunneling. Its written in PHP but it executes bash commands.

Iâ€™m publishing this here because it might be useful to others, but you use it at your own risks.

*dbsync* uses a configuration file to  define environments (like dev, prod, preprod, etc.) and replacements (different values for different environments). Have a look at the `dbsync.json` example config.

Use `dbsync --help` to get help.

A typical usage is `dbsync --source dev --target preprod` to synchronize the `dev` database with the `preprod` database (moving from `dev` to `prod` and replacing `dev` values with `prod` values).

## ssh tunneling

This tool can works with remote database through SSH. Simply define `ssh` entry in the choosen environment. If your SSH key is set, no password will be prompted.

## search / replace

This tool use [interconnectit/Search-Replace-DB
](https://github.com/interconnectit/Search-Replace-DB) for the replacements work. It is stored in *base64* in the *dbsync* command file.

Search-Replace-DB, *srdb*, is updated through composer and stored in *dbsync* with a composer script: *update-srdb*.

Some Search-Replace-DB command line options are usable: `tables`, `include-cols`, `exclude-cols` and `regex`. They must be defined for each replacement (see `dbsync.json`) using long option name.

## files

It is possible to use a file name in place of the environment name, either as source or as target. The replacements are done when synchronizing from a file to an environment (replacements are always done on target database).

To dump a database to a file: `dbsync --source prod --target prod-dump.sql`

To restore from a file: `dbsync --source prod-dump.sql --target prod`
